# Bati-Cuisine: Application d'Estimation des Coûts de Construction des Cuisines

## Description

**Bati-Cuisine** is a Java application designed for construction and renovation professionals to estimate the costs of kitchen projects. The application calculates the total cost of work by considering both materials used and labor costs, with the latter charged by the hour. Key features include client management, customized quote generation, and a comprehensive overview of financial and logistical aspects of renovation projects.

## Features

- **Component Management**: Add and manage components including materials and labor.
- **Quote Association**: Associate a quote with the project to estimate costs before starting work.
- **Project Details**:
  - `nomProjet` (String): Name of the construction or renovation project.
  - `margeBeneficiaire` (double): Profit margin applied to the total cost.
  - `coutTotal` (double): Total cost calculated for the project.
  - `etatProjet` (Enum): Status of the project (In Progress, Completed, Canceled).

### 2. Component Management
- **Materials**: Manage material costs with detailed attributes.
  - `nom` (String): Name of the component.
  - `coutUnitaire` (double): Unit cost of the component.
  - `quantite` (double): Quantity used.
  - `typeComposant` (String): Type of component (Material or Labor).
  - `tauxTVA` (double): VAT rate applicable to the component.
  - `coutTransport` (double): Transportation cost of the material.
  - `coefficientQualite` (double): Quality coefficient of the material.
- **Labor**: Calculate labor costs based on hourly rates, hours worked, and worker productivity.
  - `nom` (String): Name of the component.
  - `typeComposant` (String): Type of component (Material or Labor).
  - `tauxTVA` (double): VAT rate applicable to the component.
  - `tauxHoraire` (double): Hourly rate of labor.
  - `heuresTravail` (double): Hours worked.
  - `productiviteOuvrier` (double): Productivity factor of the workers.

### 3. Client Management
- **Client Records**: Register basic client information and differentiate between professional and private clients.
- **Discounts**: Apply specific discounts based on client type (e.g., regular or professional clients).
- **Client Details**:
  - `nom` (String): Client's name.
  - `adresse` (String): Client's address.
  - `telephone` (String): Client's phone number.
  - `estProfessionnel` (boolean): Indicates if the client is a professional.

### 4. Quote Creation
- **Quote Generation**: Create quotes before starting work, including cost estimates for materials, labor, equipment, and taxes.
- **Quote Details**:
  - `montantEstime` (double): Estimated amount of the project based on the quotes.
  - `dateEmission` (Date): Quote issuance date.
  - `dateValidite` (Date): Quote validity date.
  - `accepte` (boolean): Indicates if the quote has been accepted by the client.

### 5. Cost Calculation
- **Cost Integration**: Include component costs (materials and labor) in the total project cost calculation.
- **Profit Margin**: Apply a profit margin to determine the final project cost.
- **Taxes and Discounts**: Account for applicable VAT and client-specific discounts.
- **Cost Adjustments**: Adjust costs based on material quality or labor productivity.

### 6. Detailed Results and Display
- **Project Summary**: Display complete project details including client information, components, and total cost.
